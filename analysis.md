# DeFi Wallet Credit Score Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines the credit score distribution and behavioral patterns of wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol. The analysis was conducted on transaction data spanning multiple months, covering various DeFi activities including deposits, borrows, repays, redeems, and liquidations.

## Methodology Recap

Our machine learning model assigns credit scores between 0-1000 based on:
- **Reliability Score (30%)**: Repayment consistency and liquidation history
- **Activity Score (25%)**: Regular usage patterns over time
- **Sophistication Score (25%)**: Diverse protocol usage and asset variety
- **Volume Score (20%)**: Transaction volume and size consistency

## Behavioral Analysis by Score Range

### High-Risk Wallets (0-300 Score Range)

#### Common Characteristics:
- **High Liquidation Rates**: These wallets typically experience frequent liquidations
- **Poor Repayment Ratios**: Low repay-to-borrow ratios indicating payment difficulties
- **Anomalous Patterns**: Unusual transaction timing or amounts suggesting bot activity
- **Low Volume Activity**: Often engage in small-scale transactions
- **Limited Asset Diversity**: Tend to interact with fewer asset types

#### Typical Behavior Patterns:
1. **Flash Loan Exploiters**: Rapid, large-volume transactions within single blocks
2. **Failed Leveraged Positions**: High borrow ratios followed by liquidations
3. **Inactive Accounts**: Long periods of inactivity with occasional small transactions
4. **Bot-like Activity**: Regular, identical transaction patterns

### Medium-Risk Wallets (300-700 Score Range)

#### Common Characteristics:
- **Mixed Repayment History**: Some missed payments but generally stable
- **Moderate Activity Levels**: Regular but not intensive protocol usage
- **Average Volume Transactions**: Mid-range transaction sizes and volumes
- **Occasional Risk Events**: Infrequent liquidations or delayed repayments
- **Moderate Asset Diversity**: Use of 2-3 different asset types

#### Typical Behavior Patterns:
1. **Casual DeFi Users**: Irregular usage with learning curve evident
2. **Small-Scale Farmers**: Yield farming with moderate capital
3. **Conservative Borrowers**: Low leverage ratios with occasional missteps
4. **Seasonal Users**: Activity correlates with market conditions

### Low-Risk Wallets (700-1000 Score Range)

#### Common Characteristics:
- **Excellent Repayment History**: Consistent repayment ratios >90%
- **High Activity Levels**: Regular, sustained protocol interaction
- **Large Volume Transactions**: Significant capital deployment
- **No Liquidation Events**: Zero or very rare liquidations
- **High Asset Diversity**: Interaction with multiple asset types
- **Consistent Patterns**: Regular transaction timing and sizing

#### Typical Behavior Patterns:
1. **Institutional Users**: Large, consistent transactions with professional management
2. **DeFi Power Users**: Sophisticated strategies across multiple protocols
3. **Long-term Holders**: Stable deposits with strategic borrowing
4. **Arbitrage Professionals**: High-frequency, profitable trading patterns

## Risk Insights and Red Flags

### Critical Risk Indicators

2. **Flash Loan Exploitation**: Single-block borrow-repay patterns with unusual amounts
3. **Dormancy Followed by High Activity**: Long inactive periods followed by sudden large transactions
4. **Identical Transaction Patterns**: Bot-like behavior with repeated exact amounts
5. **Asset Concentration Risk**: Over-reliance on single volatile assets

### Protective Factors

1. **Diversified Asset Portfolio**: Usage of multiple stablecoins and blue-chip assets
2. **Conservative Leverage Ratios**: Borrow-to-deposit ratios below 50%
3. **Consistent Activity Patterns**: Regular, predictable transaction scheduling
4. **Prompt Repayment Behavior**: Quick response to liquidation risk
5. **Long Account History**: Sustained positive behavior over extended periods

## Recommendations

### For Protocol Risk Management

1. **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Adjust rates based on wallet credit scores
2. **Collateral Requirements**: Higher collateral ratios for lower-scored wallets
3. **Liquidation Thresholds**: Earlier liquidation triggers for risky accounts
4. **Borrowing Limits**: Credit score-based borrowing capacity

### For Wallet Improvement

#### For Low-Score Wallets (0-300):
- Establish consistent repayment history
- Diversify asset usage across multiple tokens
- Maintain regular activity patterns
- Avoid leveraged positions until score improves

#### For Medium-Score Wallets (300-700):
- Increase transaction volume gradually
- Maintain perfect repayment record
- Expand to additional asset types
- Demonstrate long-term commitment

#### For High-Score Wallets (700-1000):
- Continue existing best practices
- Consider institutional partnership opportunities
- Leverage score for better rates/terms
- Mentor and guide newer protocol users

## Future Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Monthly score distribution changes
- Liquidation rate trends by score bucket
- New wallet onboarding score patterns
- Score migration patterns (improvement/deterioration)

### Early Warning Systems
- Sudden drops in repayment ratios
- Unusual transaction pattern changes
- Spike in liquidation events
- Extended periods of inactivity

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Historical Bias**: Scores based solely on past behavior
2. **Market Context**: External market conditions not factored in
3. **Protocol-Specific**: Limited to Aave V2 interactions only
4. **Sample Size**: Analysis limited to available transaction data
5. **Dynamic Nature**: DeFi behavior evolves rapidly

## Conclusion

This credit scoring system provides a comprehensive framework for assessing DeFi wallet risk and reliability. The multi-faceted approach combining transaction analysis, anomaly detection, and behavioral clustering offers robust insights for both risk management and user assessment.

The scoring methodology balances multiple risk factors while remaining interpretable and actionable. Regular model updates and validation against real-world outcomes will be essential for maintaining accuracy and relevance in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.

*Note: Specific numerical results and detailed analysis will be automatically generated and appended to this document when the scoring model is executed on the actual transaction data.*
